The function to run simulations is contained in the Run.py file but it requires the two other files SetUp.py and Function.py
The function to run simulations is Main(dt, T, SubT, N_chemical, Folder)
dt : time step in days 
T : final time in days
SubT : subdivision of time step for the diffusion of molecules
N_chemical : number of chemical group i, note N_chemical = 0 for 1 chemical group, so N_chemical = 2 represents 2 chemical groups
Folder: Name of the folder to store graphs
Parameters are stored in Parameter.csv file with a column for the name of the literature source, the full names of the sources are in the Source.txt file.
